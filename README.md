# Developer Challenge
### Intro
Thank you for your interest in the Expert Software Developer position at **WarnerMedia** for the 
Crossroad team. We have asked you to complete a developer challenge to assess your handson development skills and to start a conversation during the technical interview. 
### Business Requirements
* Build a Web application that displays Title information
* The user must be able to search for a Title by its name.
* The system must display the titles that match the above criteria.
* The system must allow the user to pull up detailed information about a selected title 
from the list.
### Technical Requirements
For the Crossroad project, we would like you to perform this task using the following tech stack:
* SQL Express --> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads
* Attached to this email is a zipped version of data to seed your instance. (NOTE: Within 
the zip file, the file extension has been changed from .sql to .txt to avoid attachment 
inspection issues on email servers. If the attachment doesn't exist, please reach out 
immediately.)
* Create an API layer in C# --> this may be .NET Core or .NET Framework
* Create a front-end with React-Redux v7.2
* Include a readme.txt (or readme.md) file that gives steps on how to setup the project to 
be executed (you can omit the SQL Express setup).
Timeline
You have up to 48 hours from the time of this email to complete the challenge.
Delivery
* Push it up to a github or bitbucket public repository.
* Send an email with a URL to your repository.Hints
* Be creative and do your best to impress us! This is your opportunity to show us how 
you code a task.
* Form is as important as function. If your app works, but is written like a website from 
2001, that would be bad. 
* We're suckers for clean and modern code.
* Time permitting, feel free to add enhancements to the listed requirements.
* Be prepared to explain any architectural decisions you make.
* Treat this code as if it was going to production (i.e., Good comments, remove dead 
code/templated code, etc.)
### Summary
Following completion, we will review your submission and see that it met the requirements. If 
the requirement were met, we will schedule a video conference call to have the technical 
interview. Please be prepared to present and demo your code.
